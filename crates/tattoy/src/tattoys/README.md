# Core Tattoys

These are the core tattoys that come with Tattoy by default. For example; the scrollbar, colour correction etc. Most tattoys will be provided by plugins.

Though these tattoys are internal to the codebase, I want to try to make them follow the same restrictions as plugins. Therefore, mostly trying to limit communication to the "input" and "output" channels.
