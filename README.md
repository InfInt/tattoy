## TODO
* [ ] Background colour of " " (space) isn't passed through.
* [ ] Greys or bold don't get passed through properly, run `htop` to see.
* [ ] Mouse events don't seem to be faithfully parsed see `htop`.
* [ ] Resizing isn't detected.
* [ ] Double width characters aren't passed through, eg "ðŸ¦€".
* [ ] Up and down aren't detected in `less`.
* [ ] `CTRL-D` doesn't fully return to terminal, needs extra `CTRL-C`.
* [ ] Doesn't work on Nushell. Just freezes.
